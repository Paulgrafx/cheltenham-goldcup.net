	Cheltenham Gold Cup Result 2009</h1>
<p>
	A great race once again , which saw this time the fortunes of the first and second home in 2008, reverse places, with this time Kauto Star coming home in front.</p>
<p>
	Try as he might, Denman who took the 2008 Gold Cup by storm, was not quite up to the mark, and was clearly mot back to his absolute best since his heart operation earlier in the year. Nonetheless he ran a terrific race, but the plaudirs were all for the magnifiucent Kauto Star who is fact moving into the legendary racehorse category, with two Gold Cups and three King George Chases.</p>
<p>
	Another brave run saw the now late lamented, Exotic Dancer placed third</p>
<p>
	1. Kauto Star (R Walsh) 7/4Fav<br />
	2. Denman (S Thomas) 7/1<br />
	3. Exotic Dancer (Tony McCoy) 8/1<br />
