<p>The 2010 <a href="http://www.cheltenham-goldcup.net/">Cheltenham Gold Cup </a>was full of drama and excitement as we had hoped for, all eyes before the off were on Kauto Star as he looked for his third win in the race while punters were also looking to back the 2008 winner Denman to go well. Nigel Twiston-Davies had been singing the praises of Imperial Commander all season and his record at Cheltenham had to be respected before the off.</p>
<p>It was plain to see early on that Kauto Star was not travelling all that well and after clattering a fence on the back straight did well to stay up right, it didn't last long though as Kauto Star fell under pressure to leave Imperial Commander and Denman to fight out a tense finish. Denman ran an absolute blinder with AP McCoy on board but when push came to shove he was unable to beat the younger horse. Imperial Commander was travelling like a dream and when Paddy Brennan asked him the question over the final fence he answered emphatically and got up to claim the win for Nigel Twiston-Davies.</p>
