<p>Kempes is a horse that has thrown his name into the <a href="http://www.cheltenham-goldcup.net/">Gold Cup</a> picture relatively late this season with his brilliant win in the <a href="http://www.cheltenham-goldcup.net/irish-hennessy-gold-cup.html">Irish Hennessy Gold Cup</a> persuading connections to send him to the Cheltenham Festival. Kempes is trained over in Ireland by Willie Mullins and owned by JP McManus which means that he is the likely ride of AP McCoy in this year's Gold Cup. Kempes started his season over just 2m 1f at Fairyhouse back in December when third but he was clearly staying on and was in need of further.</p>

<p>We next saw Kempes take in the Lexus Chase at Leopardstown over the Christmas period and he was jumping and travelling with ease when unseating McCoy at the second last. The race proved he was happy over 3 miles but the mistake set his preparations for Cheltenham back somewhat. Kempes really came alive at Leopardstown at the start of February when he ran an excellent race to win the Irish Hennessy. That win was on heavy ground and with the fact that he will prefer the quicker ground of Cheltenham he now becomes a lively outsider in the Gold Cup market and plenty will be wanting to back him a little bit each-way.</p>]]></content><articles></articles></page>
