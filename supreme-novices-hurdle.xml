<p>The first race of the <a href="http://www.cheltenham-goldcup.net/cheltenham-festival.html">2015 Cheltenham Festival</a> is the Supreme Novices Hurdle, the start of the race is greeted with a huge roar from the Cheltenham stands as we see the young hurdlers take their chance. There is always a huge build up to the Supreme Novices as we get to see the superstars of the future take their first steps in the big time, we had a fantastic winner in Champagne Fever last year who stormed up the hill to claim a memorable win for Willie Mullins.</p>

<p>We have two fancied horses for the race today with Douvan and <strong>L'Ami Serge</strong> both coming into the race in great form for Willie Mullins and Nicky Henderson.</p>
