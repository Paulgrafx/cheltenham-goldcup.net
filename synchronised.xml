	Cheltenham Gold Cup Contenders 2013 - Synchronised</h1>
<p>
	2012 saw Synchronised write his name into the Gold Cup history books when he won the race in brilliant style at the <a href="http://www.cheltenham-goldcup.net/cheltenham-festival.html">Cheltenham Festival</a>. The Jonjo O&#39;Neill horse surprised many with the way he won the race but he will now be a major player in the ante-post betting for 2013. The horse stays all day at Cheltenham which will ensure he is right in the mix once again if he arrives fit and well for the big race.</p>

	Synchronised has gone from a top class handicapper to a Gold Cup winner in the space of 18 months and it will be interesting to follow his progress on the way to the 2103 Festival. During the 2012 Gold Cup he comfortably out stayed the likes of Long Run and Burton Port and those horses will do well to turn the tables the next time they meet. We saw Synchronised win the Lexus Chase in 2011 on his way to Gold Cup glory and it would be no surprise to see him head down the same route again in 2012/13.</p>

	We will be following Synchronised through every race in his build up to the Gold Cup as his connections aim to turn him into the first back-to-back winner of the race since Best Mate.</p>
