	Ladbrokes World Hurdle Race Card</h1>
<p>
	The Ladbrokes World Hurdle is the feature race on day 3 of the Cheltenham Festival and it is always a brilliant renewal for punters to get stuck into. Any horse wanting to run well here will need to have stamina aplenty as well as the ability to jump the hurdles at a good clip. The Race Card will be available on race day and will include all the runners with the betting and form line for each of them, while punters can also check out the colours of their selection.</p>
