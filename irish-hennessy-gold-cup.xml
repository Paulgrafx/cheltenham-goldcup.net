<p>The Irish Hennessy Gold Cup is run at Leopardstown each February and acts as a brilliant <a href="http://www.cheltenham-goldcup.net/">Cheltenham Gold Cup</a> Trial race; it will predominantly feature the Irish contenders for the Gold Cup as they take in one last run before heading across to Cheltenham for the Festival. It serves as an ideal prep for several horses with about five or so weeks to go until the Festival and for those runners that need a tune up it proves a hugely beneficial race.</p>

<p>It is a race that attracts the very best chasers over 3 miles and we have seen some great names pick up the win in recent years, the best of them all was perhaps Florida Pearl who the race four times while Beef or Salmon won on no less than three occasions. In the 90's we saw both Jodami and then Imperial Call win the Irish Hennessy before going to win the Gold Cup at Cheltenham.</p>
