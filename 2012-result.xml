	Cheltenham Gold Cup Result 2012</h1>
<p>
	We have had a great <a href="http://www.cheltenham-goldcup.net/">Gold Cup</a> this year with a surprise winner in the form of Synchronised for Jonjo O&#39;Neill and owner JP McManus. AP McCoy looked to be struggling on the horse early on but he stayed on brilliantly to pass Long Run and The Giant Bolster over the last and in the end he won a touch cosily.</p>
<p>
	A special mention should go to Kauto Star who was pulled up on the first circuit after struggling to travel. He clearly was not at his best after his fall at home and he could have made his last visit to a race track as a runner , he was given a massive round of applause as he came in.</p>
