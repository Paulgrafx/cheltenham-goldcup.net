<p>The Fred Winter Handicap Hurdle is a cracking race for four year olds at the Festival, there will be a big field as always for this race making it a tough one for punters to make sense of. At the same time though there can also be plenty of value on offer for the shrewdies out there in a large handicap such as this, while two favourites have also won the race since it was first run in 2005.</p>

<p>Sanctuaire won this race as favourite in 2010 for Paul Nicholls and the Ditcheat trainer is sure to have another nice type this season. The race is always one of the most interesting of the <a href="http://www.cheltenham-goldcup.net/cheltenham-festival.html">Cheltenham Festival</a> and that looks like being the case once again this year.</p>
