<p>The David Nicholson Mares Hurdle gives the horses here a chance to race against their own gender and in recent years we had a winner in Quevega of the very highest quality. It was added to the <a href="http://www.cheltenham-goldcup.net/cheltenham-festival.html">Cheltenham Festival</a> in 2008 but has already become a popular race with fans and punters in that short time.</p>

<p>All eyes this season are on <strong>Annie Power</strong> who is hoping to give Willie Mullins and Ruby Walsh yet another win in the race.</p>
