	The Foxhunter Chase Race Card is the one after the Gold Cup so and is a decent betting event despite the fact it is always a tough one for punters to pick over. The Race Card should be the first port of call for any <a href="http://www.cheltenham-goldcup.net/foxhunter-chase.html">Foxhunter Chase</a> punter and it will include all the info on each of the runners in the race.
