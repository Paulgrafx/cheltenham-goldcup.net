	2006 Cheltenham Gold Cup Result</h1>
<p>
	<img align="right" alt="2006 Cheltenham Gold Cup" src="images/war_of_attrition.jpg" />This was one of the most open Gold Cup&#39;s in years and the bookies made Beef Or Salmon the 4/1 favourite and that just highlights why there was such ingterest from all the trainers in the UK and Ireland to take their place as anything had the opportunity to win the race with the absentee of the previous years winner Kicking King.</p>
<p>
	The winner War Of Attrition had good form with the Champion Hurdle winner Brave Inca and while he had stamina to prove, he had given plenty of encouragement over three miles against Beef Or Salmon at Leopardstown at Christmas.</p>
<p>
	In the race War Of Attrition got into the race on the final circuit out in the country and he went on from Forget The Past as they rounded the bypassed third-last and found plenty when Hedgehunter challenged him, keeping on strongly up the hill to win by 21/2 lengths from the consistent HedgeHunter.</p>
