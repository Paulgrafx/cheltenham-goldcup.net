<p>The Arkle Trophy is the second race on the Day 1 card at the <a href="http://www.cheltenham-goldcup.net/cheltenham-festival.html">Cheltenham Festival</a> and it is a race that of course is named after the legendary chaser, it is one of the most popular races for up and coming chasers over the 2 mile distance.</p>

<p>We have had some cracking winners of the race in recent years with Forpadydeplasterer winning in 2009 Sizing Europe in 2010 just two of the notable names on the roll of honour. A number of nice horses are running this year including <strong>Un De Sceaux</strong> who has been very impressive so far this season for Willie Mullins.</p>
