<p>The <a href="http://www.cheltenham-goldcup.net/william-hill-trophy-handicap.html">Festival Handicap Chase</a> at Cheltenham is always one of the key race son the first day of the Festival each March. We have had some good winners of the race over the past few years with horses like Wichita Lineman and Bensalem claiming the success over recent years. It&#39;s always a fascinating betting heat for punters and the 2014 race is looking like a top class one. The full race card always makes for interesting reading with the form and odds for each horse available on race day.</p>
