<p>The Neptune Novices Hurdle is always a competitive race as we get those novice hurdlers who need who fall between that 2 and 3 mile trip which can be awkward for connections to decide between. The standard has remained high in recent years and that is highlighted by winners like Hardy Eustace in 2003 and Mikael D'haguenet in 2009 while Peddlers Cross was no slouch in winning the race for Donald McCain Jnr in 2010.</p>
