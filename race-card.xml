<p>The <a href="http://www.cheltenham-goldcup.net/">Gold Cup</a> is the biggest race of the season with the best 3 mile chasers in the UK and Ireland clashing on the final day of the Cheltenham Festival. Punters will be able to study the race card during the week of the race with form lines and connection information also available to study.</p>

<p>The race card is an excellent tool for punters to use before making a bet as it will have all the information they need before making a bet on the big race. There will be some great value on offer for punters this season as Lord Windermere on the likes of Silviniaco Conti and Road To Riches.</p>
