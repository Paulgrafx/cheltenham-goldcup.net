<p>The Cross Country Handicap is like no other Festival race as the field take in all manner of obstacles both on the race course and in the middle of the course, this race really tests the navigational skills of the jockeys as they wind and turn their way around the course. As well as the usual fences we have grass banks, water jumps and Aintree fences for the Cross Country runners to deal with, this is what makes the race so special for fans and punters alike at the <a href="http://www.cheltenham-goldcup.net/cheltenham-festival.html">Cheltenham Festival</a>.</p>

<p>In recent years the Irish have had something of a stranglehold on the Cross Country race with trainer Enda Bolger in particular holding a great record in the race, he has saddled four winners of the race including Garde Champetre who won in 2008 and 2009.</p>
