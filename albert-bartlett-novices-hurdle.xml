<p>The Albert Bartlett Novices Hurdle has been run at the <a href="http://www.cheltenham-goldcup.net/cheltenham-festival.html">Cheltenham Festival</a> since 2005 but it is now a firm favourite with punters as we see the novice hurdlers race over 3 miles. It is a staying race so it can be an exciting race over the final mile and we have had some excellent winners recently, Weapons Amnesty won the race in 2009 before going onto win the RSA Chase last season so it can be an excellent starting point for staying hurdlers.</p>
