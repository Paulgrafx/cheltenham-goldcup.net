	2008 Gold Cup Result</h1>
<p>
	<img align="right" alt="Denman 2008 Gold Cup" src="images/denman.jpg" />The Gold Cup in 2008 was all about the showdown between the Paul Nicholls duo, the <a href="http://www.cheltenham-goldcup.net/2007-result.html">2007 Cheltenham Gold winner </a>in Kauto Star and the new kid on the block Denman. Coming into the race the online bookmakers could not seperate them and they went off pretty much joint favourites.</p>
<p>
	All that changed very quicky as Denman as usual laid up with the pace and took it up with a circuit to run and Kauto just did not have any answers, to his stable mate.</p>
<p>
	In the end Denman won easily by seven lengths with Kauto Star just managing to hold off his other stable mate Neptune Collonges for second place, giving Paul Nicholls the first 3 home in the race.</p>
