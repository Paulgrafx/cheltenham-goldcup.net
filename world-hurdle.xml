<p>The World Hurdle is the highlight on the Day 3 card of the the <a href="http://www.cheltenham-goldcup.net/cheltenham-festival.html">Cheltenham Festival</a> and it is a race that over the past few years in particular has grown in stature, there has been one or two superstar champion of the world Hurdle including Ingles Drever and Big Buck's. The Paul Nicholls trained horse won the race four times during his career but his retirement has left the division looking much more open.</p>

<p>That has left the betting wide open with the likes of <strong>Zarkandar</strong> and <strong>Saphir Du Rheu</strong> being well backed to run well in a wide open looking contest this season.</p>
