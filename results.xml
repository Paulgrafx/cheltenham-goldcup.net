<h2>
	2011 Cheltenham Gold Cup Winner - Long Run</h2>
<p>
	The new kid on the block Long Run won a thrilling Gold Cup and will be looking to come back next year to defend his title. He held off a great run from Denman who ran a blinder in second but in the end it was the younger legs of Long Run that triumphed in a famous Cheltenham finish.</p>

<h2>
	2010 Cheltenham Gold Cup Winner - Imperial Commander</h2>
<p>
	It was the end of an era as Kauto Star fell as an odds-on favourite while Denman could only finish second as Imperial Commander produced a flawless display to claim the big prize at good looking odds.</p>

<h2>
	2009 Cheltenham Gold Cup Winner - Kauto Star</h2>
<p>
	Kauto Star came back to his absolute best to take the race from the game Denman and in the process has put himself in line to be hailed one of the greatest steeplechasers of all time. His win over Denman was as emphatic as it could have been and he will no doubt be back in 2010 to defend his crown.</p>

<h2>
	2008 Cheltenham Gold Cup Winner - Denman</h2>
<p>
	<a href="http://www.cheltenham-goldcup.net/2008-result.html">Denman</a> proved that he was no longer the understudy to Kauto Star as he beat him fairly and squarely doing it his way. Denman has the sheer power and strength and out stayed his stable mate. Always up with the pace he took up the running on the final circuit and got the better of his other stable companion Neptune Collonges who stay on well to fight out second spot with Kauto Star.</p>
<h2>
	2007 Cheltenham Gold Cup Winner - Kauto Star</h2>
<p>
	The <a href="http://www.cheltenham-goldcup.net/2007-result.html">2007 Cheltenham Gold Cup </a>was all about one horse with all the build up being about the horse that had taken all before him in the season by winning the Betfair Chase, The King George, The Tingle Creek and was looking to get the Betfair &iuml;&iquest;&frac12;1 million bonus by winning the Cheltenham Gold Cup. There was one flaw in his armoury and that was the famous last flight blunder. Ruby Walsh showed all the confidence in the World and put him into the lead going to the last and while he made a slight error at the last he went on to win well.</p>
<h2>
	2006 Cheltenham Festival Winner - War of Attrition</h2>
<p>
	This was one of the most open Gold Cups in recent years as Kicking King was injured and was unable to take his place in the line up. The Irish were having a really good Cheltenham Festival and <a href="http://www.cheltenham-goldcup.net/2006-result.html">War of Attrition </a>was the new kid on the block and while he had had a quite build up to the race and there were his supporters he ran a perfect race and was a good winner on the day.</p>
<h2>
	2005 Cheltenham Gold Cup Winner - Kicking King</h2>
<p>
	Best Mate the winner of the Gold cup Odds for the previous three years was absent following an injury in the week leading up to the race and this left favourite Kicking King the King George Winner the opportunity to continue a growing trend of horses that win the King George and follow up in the same year with the Gold Cup. Kicking King made no mistake and put himself up as a horse that could follow in Best Mates hoof steps.</p>
<h2>
	2002-2004 Cheltenham Gold Cup Winner - Best Mate</h2>
<p>
	<a href="http://www.cheltenham-goldcup.net/legends.html">Best Mate </a>became a real favourite with the racing public as he was a beautiful horse that had real grace and produced fantastic displays on the Cheltenham racecourse. His trainer Henrietta Knight took a lot of stick for wrapping up Best Mate in cotton wool and not letting him run too often and we have seen in recent times that that decision was a very astute one and resulted in him returning for three consecutive years in 2002, 2003 and 2004 to retain his title. Anyone who saw him run on the racetrack will go away having seen poetry in motion and why we all love a real class racehorse.</p>
